# Prompts used to generate results

NOTE: I was originally using the excel prompt, but it is much simpler to just ask for the json and convert it to excel later. The models seem to want to return json and script a conversion tool anyways

NOTE: I had mistakenly been using a prompt that used "The Real Book Volume 6" previously which has now been corrected to "The Real Book Volume I Sixth Edition". Only Claude 4 Opus seemed to have pick up on this mistake -- 07-26-2025
